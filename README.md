Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
What did you do particularly well?

  The DriverPass project was a system design project for DriverPass, a group looking to provide a modern and accessible approach to driver's education. DriverPass wanted a system that could be readily available to students to complete course work and schedule live driving exorcises with staffed instructors. The instructors also needed access to the system to update their schedule/availability. Admins needed access for exclusive access and the ability to download content to work offline. I exorcised foresight in the design process, creating the system in a way that it could be easily scaled with company growth.
  
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

  If I could revise the system documents in some way, I would work to further develop the power point presentation to more clearly display the system and its intent. The presentation is minimal, and depending on the audience, may lose a lot of the design components in translation. 
  
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

  I tried to consider the most important pieces for the user to find the most efficient design for the system. DriverPass voiced that they didn't mind looking at additional components down the line in production, so I focused on designing an iteration containing their prioritized components. At the end of the day, the design is simply an extension of the client's intent for their business. It is important to adhere to their wishes to design a system worthy of their intent. 
  
How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

  I approach designing software in an iterative process. It is imperative to produce deliverables and receive feedback to most accurately adhere to client needs. Maintaining an Agile space encourages this process. The utilization of UML models aids in conveying instruction to a team that does not have the time to communicate verbally over the characteristics of the design.
